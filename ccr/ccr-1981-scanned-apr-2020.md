Any attempt to make a prohibited transfer is void.

- **3.3 VOTING CLASSES:** The Association shall have two (2) classes of voting members.

  - 3.3.1 Class A: Class A members shall be all Unit Owners with the exception of Declarant. Class A Members shall have one (1) vote for each Unit.

Said vote shall be cast by the designated "Voting Owner" for that Unit as hereinafter provided. Fractional votes shall not be allowed and in no event shall more than one vote be cast with respect to any one Unit.\
\
  When more than one (1) person owns a single Unit, there shall be one "Voting Owner" for such Unit. The "Voting Owner" shall be designated by the record Owner or Owners for each Unit by written notice to the Board. Said designation shall be revocable at any time by actual notice to the Board given by any of the Unit Owners of record or by the death or judicially declared mental incompetence of any record unit Owner. The power herein conferred to designate a "Voting Owner" and to revoke said designation may be exercised by the Unit Owner's conservator, by the guardian of his estate, by the parent or parents entitled to custody of an Owner in the case of the Owner being a minor, or, during the administration of his estate, by the executor or administrator of a deceased record Unit Owner where the latter's interest in said property is subject to administration of his estate. Where no "Voting Owner" of a Unit has been designated, or where said designation has been revoked as provided, the vote for such Unit shall be exercised as the majority of co-Owners of the Unit mutually agree. No vote shall be cast for any Unit where there is no designated "Voting Owner" and the majority of co-Owners present and representing said Unit cannot agree to said vote or other action.

  - 3.3.2 Class B: The Class B Member shall be Declarant. The Class B Member shall be entitled to three (3) votes for each Unit owned, provided that the Class B membership shall cease and be converted to Class A membership on the happening of either of the following events, whichever occurs earlier:

      - (1) When the votes outstanding in the Class A membership equal the votes outstanding in the Class B membership; or

      - (2) Upon the date which is the second anniversary of the original issuance of the original Final Subdivision Public Report for the Project.

    Upon the expiration of the Class B membership, with respect to each provision of this Declaration which requires the vote of both classes of Members, the same shall be read as requiring both (a) the vote of the prescribed percentage of all of the Class A Members and (b) as long as Declarant holds or directly controls twenty-five percent (25%) of the voting power of the Association, the vote of the prescribed percentage of the Class A Members other than Declarant.

The initial Board of Directors of the Association consisting of three (3) directors shall be appointed by Declarant. Such Board shall hold office until the first regular meeting of the Members is held pursuant to the By-Laws. At said meeting a new Board of three (3) directors shall be elected by secret written ballot to serve until the next regular annual meeting of the Association Members and until their successors are elected. The number of Directors may be changed by amendment of the By-Laws. At each subsequent annual meeting, the membership shall elect a Board of Directors. As long as there are two (2) classes of voting membership outstanding or as long as the majority of voting power of the Association otherwise resides in Declarant, special procedures shall be adopted to assure that no less than twenty percent (20%) of the Directors have been elected solely by the vote of Members other than Declarant.

- **3.6 NOTICE OF INCUMBENCY:** The Board of Directors shall record with the County Recorder of the County in which the Project is situated a notice stating the names and addresses of the persons elected to the Board of Directors.

The most recently recorded of such notices shall be prima facie evidence that the persons named therein are all of the incumbent members of the Board of Directors and shall be conclusive evidence of the exercise of any authority thereby as to any bona fide purchaser or other third person who supplies labor or material to the managers, or to any other person who relies thereon in good faith.

- **3.7 GENERAL POWERS, DUTIES AND AUTHORITY OF ASSOCIATION:** The Association shall have all of the powers set forth in this Declaration and the By-Laws, together with the general power to do any and all things that a corporation organized under the laws of the State of California may lawfully do in operating for the benefit of its members, subject only to the limitations upon the exercise of such powers as are expressly set forth in the By-Laws and this Declaration.

# ARTICLE IV
## MAINTENANCE ASSESSMENTS AND ASSOCIATION FUNDS

- **4.1 COVENANTS FOR MAINTENANCE ASSESSMENTS:** Declarant hereby covenants and agrees for each Condominium owned by it within the Project, and each Owner of any Condominium, by acceptance of a deed therefor, whether or not it shall be so expressed in any such deed or other conveyance, shall be deemed to covenant and agree to pay to the Association the right, power and authority to bring all actions for the collection of such charges and for the enforcement of the lien created thereby. Such right and power shall continue in the Association, and such obligations shall run with the land so that each successive Owner or Owners of record of a Condominium in the Project shall in turn become liable to pay all such assessments which shall become a lien thereon during the time they are the record Owner of any Condominium in the Project. Each assessment levied by the Association under this Article shall constitute a separate assessment.\
\
  Each assessment, together with interest thereon, costs of collection and reasonable attorneys' fees, shall be a charge on the Condominium and shall be a continuing lien upon the Condominium against which each such assessment is made. The Association, as the agent of all Unit Owners, shall have a separate lien, and a separate lien with power of sale is hereby created, upon each Condominium against which an assessment is made to secure the payment of any assessments under this Article IV. Each such lien for a particular month's charge shall likewise secure interest thereon, if the same is not paid when due, and costs of suit and reasonable attorneys' fees to be fixed by the court if action or suit is brought to collect such charge. The priority of all such liens shall be in adverse order so that, upon the foreclosure of the lien for a particular month's charge, any foreclosure sale pursuant thereto will be made subject to all liens securing the respective monthly charges on such Condominium for succeeding months.\
\
  Each such assessment, together with such interest, attorneys' fees and costs of collection, shall also be a separate, distinct and personal obligation of the Owner of the Condominium at the time when the assessment fell due and shall bind his heirs, devisees, personal representatives and assigns. The personal obligation for delinquent assessments shall not pass to a Unit Owner's successor in title unless expressly assumed by such successor, but the lien for such delinquent assessment shall remain and, if unpaid by such successive Unit Owner, may be foreclosed as herein provided. No such assumption of personal liability by a successor Unit Owner shall relieve any Unit Owner personally obligated hereby for delinquent assessment for such Owner's personal liability therefor. After a record Unit Owner shall transfer record title to his Condominium, he shall not be liable for any charge thereafter assessed against such Condominium. A contract seller of any Condominium shall continue to be liable for all such charges until a conveyance by him of the Condominium subject to the assessment is recorded in the Office of the County Recorder of the County in which the Project is situated.

- **4.2 MONTHLY ASSESSMENTS:**

  - 4.2.1 Regular Assessments: The Board shall establish regular monthly assessment for operation and maintenance of the Project by the procedures established in this Section. One-seventh (1/7) of the total regular monthly assessment shall be allocated to the owner of each Unit. Such assessments shall be due and payable by each Unit owner in monthly installments on the first day of each month during the continuance of this Declaration, commencing on the first day of the first month following close of escrow of the sale of the first Condominium.

  - 4.2.2 Budgeting: On or before the first business day of the first month following close of escrow of the sale of the first Condominium in the Project, the Board shall prepare and distribute to each member a pro forma operating statement (budget), based upon the budget accepted by the State of California Department of Real Estate, estimating the total expenditures to be paid out of the maintenance fund, including a reasonable reserve for contingencies and replacement for the remainder of the fiscal year. The Board shall assess one-seventh (1/7) of the total of said charges, including those items in the Project budget designated as insurance premiums and painting and roof reserves, to each of the Unit Owners.\
\
  Not less than sixty (60) days prior to the beginning of each subsequent fiscal year, the Board shall estimate the total charges to be paid out of the maintenance fund during such year (including a reasonable reserve for contingencies and less any expected surplus from the prior year) and distribute a copy of a pro forma operating statement (budget) to each member; provided, however, that the Board may not, without the prior vote or written consent of a majority of each class of members of the Association, impose a regular annual assessment per Condominium which is more than twenty percent (20%) greater than the regular assessment per Condominium for the immediately preceding fiscal year. All funds budgeted, allocated, assessed and collected for contingencies, deferred maintenance and replacement of capital improvements shall be designated for those specific purposes. Said funds shall then be used solely for the specific purpose for which said funds have been designated. Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the end of each calendar year, the Unit Owners shall receive an accounting of assessment receipts and disbursements for that calendar year. If such accounting shows that a surplus of cash results, the Unit Owners shall vote as to whether to refund all or part of such surplus or as to whether such surplus shall be carried over to future assessment periods and applied to reduce future assessments. This total budget surplus shall be traced back to the specific budget items which created the surplus and the Association shall distribute or allocate such surplus to each Unit Owner in the same proportion as their respective assessment for those budget items bears to the total assessment for those items.

- **4.3 SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS:** Except as limited below, in addition to the regular assessments authorized by Section 4.2 hereof, the Board may levy, in any fiscal year, a special assessment applicable to that year for capital improvements, corrections of inadequacy of the maintenance fund, defraying, in whole or in part, the cost of any construction, reconstruction, unexpected repair or replacement of improvements in the Common Area. Provided, however, that in any fiscal year, without the vote or written assent of a majority of the voting power of Association residing in Members other than the Declarant, the Board may not levy special assessments to defray costs of an action or undertaking on behalf of the Association which in the aggregate exceed five percent (5%) of the budgeted gross expenses of the Association for that fiscal year. Such vote or written assent shall be had at a meeting duly called for the purpose of considering such special assessment. Any such special assessment shall be based upon the ratio of the square footage of the floor area of the Unit to be assessed to the total square footage of the floor area of all Units to be assessed. Written notice of such meeting shall be given to all Members at least thirty (30) days in advance and shall set forth the purpose of the meeting. No such special assessment shall be levied prior to the commencement of the monthly assessments as provided herein. The provisions of this section shall not apply in case the Board levying an assessment against an Owner under Section 4.4 for costs incurred in bringing the Owner and his Unit into compliance with provisions of this Declaration or the Rules.

- **4.4 REIMBURSEMENT ASSESSMENTS:** The Board shall levy a reimbursement assessment against any Unit Owner and the Condominium owned by each Owner whose failure to comply with this Declaration or the Rules has necessitated an expenditure of monies by the Association from the maintenance fund to bring such Owner and Condominium into compliance with said instruments. Such assessment shall be for the purpose of reimbursing the Association, shall be limited to the amount so expended and shall be due and payable to the Association when levied.

- **4.5 NON-WAIVER OF ASSESSMENTS:** The omission by the Board, before the expiration of any year, to fix the assessments hereunder for that or the next year shall not be deemed a waiver or modification in any respect of the provisions of this Declaration or a release of any Unit Owner from the obligation to pay the assessments, or any installment thereof, for that or any subsequent year. In the instance of such omission, the assessment fixed for the preceding year shall continue until a new assessment is fixed. No Unit Owner may waive or otherwise escape liability for the assessments provided for herein by non-use of the Common Area, abandonment of the Condominium or any attempt to renounce rights in the Common Area.

- **4.6 ENFORCEMENT:** Each Unit Owner of a Condominium, upon becoming such Owner, is and shall be deemed to covenant and agree to pay to the Association each and every of the assessments provided for in this Declaration and shall be deemed to covenant and agree to the enforcement of all such assessments in the manner herein specified. In the event an attorney or attorneys are employed for collection of any assessment, whether by suit or otherwise, or to enforce compliance with or specific performance of the terms and conditions of this Declaration, each Unit Owner agrees to pay reasonable attorneys' fees and costs thereby incurred, in addition to any other amounts due or any other relief or remedy obtained against said Unit Owner, and the same shall be included in any judgment in any suit or action brought to enforce collection of delinquent assessments. Any assessment not paid when due shall be deemed delinquent. Any assessment not paid within thirty (30) days after the date on which it becomes due shall thereafter earn interest from the date of delinquency at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum. In addition to any other remedies herein or by law provided, the Association, or its authorized representative, may enforce the obligations of the Owners to pay the assessments provided for in this Declaration, and each of them, in any manner provided by law or in equity, and without any limitation of the foregoing, by either or both of the following procedures.

  - 4.6.1 Enforcement by Suit: The Association may commence and maintain a suit at law against any Unit Owner or Owners personally obligated to pay assessments for such delinquent assessments as to which they are personally obligated, such suit to be maintained in the name of the Association. Any judgment rendered in any such action shall include the amount of the delinquency, together with interest thereon, costs of collection, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees in such amount as the court may adjudge against the delinquent Unit Owner. Suit to recover judgment for unpaid assessments shall be maintainable without foreclosing or waiving the lien hereinafter provided for.

  - 4.6.2 Enforcement by Lien: There is a present lien, with power of sale on each Condominium to secure payment to the Association of any and all assessments levied against such Condominium pursuant to this Declaration, together with interest thereon, as herein provided, and all costs of collection which may be paid or incurred by the Association in connection therewith, including reasonable attorneys' fees. No action shall be brought to foreclose the lien securing an unpaid assessment until Notice of Assessment Due signed by the Board (or by any Unit Owner if the Board fails or refuses to act) has been delivered to the Unit Owner of the Condominium subject to such assessment, and a copy of such notice recorded in the Office of the Recorder of the County in which the Project is situated. Said notice shall state the amount of the assessment together with the interest, costs and reasonable attorneys' fees, a description of the Condominium against which the same has been assessed and the name or names of the record Unit Owner or Owners thereof. After the expiration of thirty (30) days from the date such Notice of Assessment Due has been recorded, an action may be commenced in the name of the Association to foreclose the lien, or such action may be commenced by any Unit Owner if the Association fails to act. Upon the declaration of an assessment and the recording of notice thereof, the Association may, at its option, declare the entire balance of all sums then due or to become due from the Unit Owner due and payable, which total sum may then be included in any suit, action or proceeding brought to collect said sum, including all costs, charges and attorneys' fees. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Declaration to the contrary, no action may be brought to foreclose the lien created hereunder, whether judicially, by power of sale or otherwise, until the expiration of ten (10) days after a copy of said Notice of Assessment Due, showing the date of recordation thereof, has been mailed to the Unit Owner of the Condominium which is described in such Notice.\
\
  Each Unit Owner does hereby waive, to the extent of any liens created pursuant to this Declaration, whether such liens are now in existence or are created at any time in the future, the benefit of any homestead or exemption laws of the State of California now in effect, or in effect from time to time hereafter.

- **4.7 POWER OF FORECLOSURE AND SALE:** Each of the Unit Owners does hereby appoint the Association, as trustee, to enforce any lien created pursuant to this Declaration and to foreclose such lien by private power of sale as provided in Division III, Part 4, Title XIV, Chapter 2, Article I of the Civil Code of the State of California and Civil Code Section 1356, as such statutes may be revised, amended or altered from time to time, or by judicial foreclosure, and does further grant the Association, as such trustee, the power and authority to sell the Condominium of any such defaulting Unit Owner, or any part thereof, for lawful money of the United States, to the highest bidder to satisfy such lien.
The lien provided for herein shall be in favor of the Association, shall be for the benefit of all Unit Owners and shall secure payment of all sums set forth in the Notice of Assessment together with all sums becoming due and payable in accordance with this Declaration after the date of recordation of said Notice of Assessment. The Association shall have the power to bid in at any foreclosure sale and to purchase, acquire, hold, lease, mortgage and convey any Condominium. In the event such foreclosure is by action of court, reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, title search fees, interest and all other costs and expenses shall be allowed to the extent permitted by law.

- **4.8 STATUS OF ASSESSMENT LIEN:** Upon request by any Unit Owner, the Association will furnish, for the benefit of any prospective purchaser or present or prospective encumbrancer of such Condominium, a statement showing all amounts then due which are secured by such lien. A reasonable fee, not to exceed Fifteen Dollars ($15.00), may be charged for the preparation of such statement.

- **4.9 CERTIFICATE OF DISCHARGE OF LIEN:** Upon payment of the delinquent assessment or the satisfaction thereof, the Association shall cause to be recorded, in the same manner as the Notice of Assessment, a further certificate stating the satisfaction and release of the lien thereof. A failure to record said certificate of discharge without good cause within thirty (30) days after written demand by the Unit Owner of the affected Condominium shall entitle him to recover a penalty of Three Hundred Dollars ($300.00) from the Board plus his actual damages.

- **4.10 SUBORDINATION OF LIEN TO ENCUMBRANCE:** Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein contained:

  - 4.10.1 The lien for assessments created by this Declaration shall be subject and subordinate to and shall not affect the rights of the holder of any recorded first mortgage or first deed of trust upon such Condominium made in good faith and for value. If a Unit Owner's interest is transferred as a result of the exercise of a power of sale or a judicial foreclosure involving a default under the first encumbrance, the lien of assessments which were due and payable prior to the transfer of said interest shall be extinguished. However, no transfer of the subdivision interest as a result of a foreclosure or exercise of a power of sale shall relieve the new owner, whether it be the former beneficiary of the first encumbrance or another person, from liability for any assessments thereafter becoming due or from the lien thereof, which lien shall have the same effect and be enforced in the same manner as provided herein.\
\
  For purposes of this Subsection, a mortgage or deed of trust may be given in good faith or for value even though the mortgagee or the beneficiary of such mortgage or deed of trust has constructive or actual knowledge of the assessment lien provisions of this Declaration.

  - 4.10.2 No amendment of this Subsection shall affect the rights of the holder of any such mortgage or deed of trust recorded prior to recordation of such amendment unless the mortgagee or beneficiary thereof joins in the execution of such amendment.

- **4.11 ASSOCIATION FUNDS:** The assessments collected by the Association shall be properly deposited into two separate bank accounts selected by the Board, which accounts shall be clearly designated as the MAUD AVENUE MANOR HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION CURRENT MAINTENANCE AND OPERATION ACCOUNT and the MAUD AVENUE MANOR HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION DEFERRED CAPITAL MAINTENANCE AND REPLACEMENT ACCOUNT. The assessments collected by the Association shall be held in trust by the Association for and on behalf of each Unit Owner and shall be used solely for the operation, care and maintenance of the Project as provided in this Declaration. The Board shall allocate a portion of said funds as collected for the annual maintenance and operation of the Project as specified in the annual budget and the Board shall allocate a portion of said funds as collected as reserves for contingencies, replacement and deferred maintenance of the capital improvements of the Project as specified in the annual budget. Said funds shall be deposited, as allocated, into the appropriate bank accounts and said accounts shall be separately maintained by the Association. Upon sale or transfer of any Unit by an Owner, the Owner's interest in the trust funds shall be deemed automatically transferred to the successor or transferee of such Owner.\
\
  In the event that the Board retains a professional management service, the Board may delegate the authority to deposit or withdraw funds to responsible representatives of the professional management agent so retained. Said professional management agent may additionally be authorized to establish a common trustee account for deposit of assessments as collected. Any funds deposited in such common trustee account shall be allocated as previously specified herein.

- **4.12 BOOKS OF ACCOUNT:** The Board shall maintain full, complete and correct books of account of the operation of the Project and vouchers supporting expenditures and the same shall be open during all reasonable hours for inspection by any Unit Owner. Any Unit Owner or the duly authorized representative thereof, may at any time and at his own expense cause an audit or inspection to be made of the books and records of the Association. Said books and records shall accurately detail in chronological order the receipts and expenditures affecting the Common Area, specifying and itemizing the maintenance and repair expenses of the Common Area and any other expenses incurred.
